NodeMCU Projects


Currently housing working Arduino IDE code for the ESP8266 NodeMCU

Wiring for NodeMCU with PIR, DHT22 and CCS811

DHT22 Data to SD3
PIR DATA to D7
CCS811 SDA to D2 SCL to D1 Wake to D3
Power for all off of 3v3 and GND to GND
Uses MQTT, firmware can be updated over MQTT 
as well! 
 
This was a fun project I did to keep track of Temp
and Co2 and Humidity in the home. 

The NodeRed exported flows are here as well,
I am running influxdb for logging and graphing
with Grafana.
